# 🎨 Color Image Channel Manipulation using OpenCV

### 📘 A College Project for **Digital Image Processing (DIP)**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates various **color channel operations** on RGB images using **OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.  
It explores how digital images are represented and manipulated across the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color channels — key concepts in **Digital Image Processing**.

The script performs:
- Channel separation
- Visualization of individual channels (in grayscale and color)
- Negative/complement transformation
- Channel swapping
- Channel removal
- Channel enhancement

Each operation helps build intuition about how colors blend and how modifying one channel affects the overall image.

## ⚙️ Features & Functionality

| Operation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Separate Channels** | Splits the image into individual R, G, B channels. |
| **Visualize Channels** | Displays each channel as grayscale and colored image maps. |
| **Color Negative (Complement)** | Creates image negative by subtracting from 255. |
| **Swap Channels** | Interchanges R-G, R-B, or G-B channels. |
| **Remove a Channel** | Sets a chosen channel (R/G/B) to zero. |
| **Enhance Channel** | Amplifies intensity of a specific color channel. |

All transformations are displayed using Matplotlib and saved locally using OpenCV.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DIP-Color-Channel-Manipulation.git
cd DIP-Color-Channel-Manipulation

2. **Install dependencies:**
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib


3. **Place your input image** in the project folder and update the image filename in the script:
image_path = 'Test Flower.jpg'


4. **Run the program:**
python main.py


5. The processed images will display in popup windows and get saved in the current directory.
